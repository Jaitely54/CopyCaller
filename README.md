Welcome to the Truecaller-Lite project! This project is a simplified version inspired by Truecaller, designed to help you understand the concepts of database management and python scripts. Truecaller is a popular mobile app that provides caller identification and spam blocking services. In this project, we'll create a basic phone number lookup service.
